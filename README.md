# Work-Day-Planner

For this weeks homework I needed to create a simple calendar applicattion that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day using the Moment.js library.

## Objectives
- When the planner is opened, the curent day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

- When user scrolls down, you can see timeblocks with standard business hours.

- When user views the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to represent if it is in the past, present or future.

- When user clicks into a timeblock, user can enter an event.

- When user clicks the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.

- When the page is refresed the event persists.
